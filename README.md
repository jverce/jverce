NAME
       jverce


DESCRIPTION
       Hi, I'm Jay. I am a computer engineer from Argentina and I am currently
       working as a software developer at Pipedream.

       I  am  interested  in  all things computers except for things with hype
       like cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT, etc.

       Other than computers, I love to laugh and have fun (who  doesn't?).   I
       am  a  big fan of stand-up comedy and I love to watch comedy movies and
       TV shows.  Football (soccer) is my favorite sport and I love to play it
       and watch it (vamos Boquita!!).


OPTIONS
       You can reach out to me via e-mail, or by visiting my website and find-
       ing all my social links there.  I usually don't answer my phone, unless
       I know who's calling and I'm expecting the call (sorry, but I get a lot
       of spam calls, I'm sure you do too).
