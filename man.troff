.SH DESCRIPTION
Hi, I'm Jay. I am a computer engineer from Argentina and I am currently working as a software developer at Pipedream.

I am interested in all things computers except for things with hype like cryptocurrencies, ChatGPT, etc.

Other than computers, I love to laugh and have fun (who doesn't?).
I am a big fan of stand-up comedy and I love to watch comedy movies and TV shows.
Football (soccer) is my favorite sport and I love to play it and watch it (vamos Boquita!!).

.SH OPTIONS
You can reach out to me via e-mail, or by visiting my website and finding all my social links there.
I usually don't answer my phone, unless I know who's calling and I'm expecting the call (sorry, but
I get a lot of spam calls, I'm sure you do too).
